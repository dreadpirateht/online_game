Started programing server and network files, working to send and recieve strings

Todo
1. change strings to arbitrary data types using pickle, and create a transfer protocol using a header first
2. create a data packet object within the network file that will store the data, as well as whether or not it has been read
3. implement a reconnect feature in the network object
4. add tables to be assigned to in the server file
