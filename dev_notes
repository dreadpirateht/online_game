9/6/21:
Started programing server and network files, working to send and recieve strings

Todo
1. change strings to arbitrary data types using pickle, and create a transfer protocol using a header first
2. create a data packet object within the network file that will store the data, as well as whether or not it has been read
3. implement a reconnect feature in the network object
4. add tables to be assigned to in the server file


Finished 1 and 2 on list above, started implementing 3 by adding a reconnect, disconnect and soft disconnect method
to the Network class. Also, made a bunch of progress on the server side by refactoring into a class and created a
method to deal with parsing server and table commands.

9/7/21:
Added project to a git repository on github, and cloned repository to laptop as well. First coding task is to make test
files for the server and network for both the laptop and home comp.

Files will be added to a server file in the scripts folder

Started adding the ability for the server and network to send commands to each other so we can reconnect and disconnect
properly

9/10/21:
Finished getting the server to accept server commands, added a disconnect command that properly disconnects a client
going to add a soft disconnect that puts the client on an idle list, and a reconnect that allows them to restablish a
connection with the server.
